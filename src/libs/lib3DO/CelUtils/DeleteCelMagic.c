**
**  Lib3DO routines to implement a universal DeleteCel().
**
**  This is another one of those conspiracy-of-agreement scams.  Any routine in
**  the library that creates cels can do so using this system so that DeleteCel()
**  knows how to free up all resources acquired when the cel was created.
**  This can help simplify an application, which can now link together lists of
**  cels in any old way, then later walk the list freeing things without
**  having to worry about how they were created.
**
**  It works like this... Whenever a library routine creates a CCB, it places
**  three magical longwords immediately ahead of the CCB in memory.  (The easiest
**  way to do this is to allocate the CCB via AllocMagicCel_().)  The first
**  longword is a magic number that validates the CCB as being a member of
**  the conspiracy.  The 2nd longword is either a pointer to some data
**  to be freed along with the CCB when the cel is deleted, or a pointer to a
**  callback function that does the freeing.  The 3rd longword is either a pointer
**  to the last cel in a group of logically related cels treated as a single entity,
**  or it is some arbitrary data that means something to a callback deletor routine.
**  The flavor of magic number used to validate the CCB determines the interpretation
**  of the 2nd & 3rd  longwords.
**
**  The magic number flavors available and the action DeleteCel takes are:
**    -     CCB_ONLY                Free the CCB only.
**    -     DATA_ONLY               Free the associated data, but not the CCB.
**    -     CCB_AND_DATA    Free both the associated data and the CCB.
**    -     CALLBACK                Call the supplied custom delete routine.
**
**  Using exactly three longwords preceeding the CCB allows LoadCel() to be a
**  participant in this scheme.  A disk-based CCB is part of a CCC chunk,
**  and a CCC happens to have exactly three longwords before the CCB part in
**  the loaded file image.  This lets LoadCel() load a file image, parse it
**  out to find the CCB pointer it wants to return within the file image, and
**  modify the longwords in front of that CCB (which are no longer needed
**  once the CCB has been located, since they're just the CCC chunk ID, size,
**  and version fields).  LoadCel() uses the DATA_ONLY magic number, and the
**  data pointer it supplies is a pointer to the loaded file image.
**
**  If a cel creator is creating just a CCB (perhaps attaching some static
**  pixel data to it or something), it can use the CCB_ONLY magic number so
**  that DeleteCel() just frees the CCB and nothing else.
**
**  If a cel creator also allocates a pixel buffer or other memory resources
**  associated with the cel, it can use the CCB_AND_DATA magic number, which
**  will free the memory resource pointed to by the free.data pointer,
**  and then free the CCB itself.  Of course, the memory in question
**  must have been allocated via AllocMem(...,MEMTYPE_TRACKSIZE), since
**  DeleteCel() will call FreeMem(..., -1).
**  With CCB_AND_DATA, an attempt is made to FreeMem() the free.data memory
**  only if the pointer is non-NULL.
**
**  And finally, if a cel creator allocates multiple memory resources, or for
**  some other reason wants to be more fully involved in the deletion process,
**  it can use the CALLBACK magic number and supply a pointer to the function
**  to call back when DeleteCel() is called for that cel.  The callback function
**  receives two parms: The CCB pointer for the cel being deleted, and the
**  creatorData for the cel.  The callback function is responsible for calling
**  FreeMagicCel_() if the CCB was allocated via AllocMagicCel_().
**
**  The interpretation of the creatorData field depends on the flavor of magic
**  number.  For CALLBACKs, it is just passed along to the callback routine.
**  For other flavors, it is a pointer to the last CCB in a group of related
**  CCBs, if non-NULL.  This gets a bit tricky; it's all involved with supporting
**  DeleteCelList() properly.  Sometimes a cel creator routine actually creates
**  several cels and links them together, and this mini-list of cels makes up a
**  single logical entity.  (Anti-aliased cels are an example of this.)  The
**  application often treats this is a single cel, which is fine.  The problem
**  arises when the application links such an entity into a larger list of cels,
**  and then later calls DeleteCelList().  The deletion activity for the first
**  CCB in the mini-list effectively frees multiple cels on the list, but the
**  DeleteCelList() routine is walking the NextPtr links doing deletions for
**  every CCB it finds.  Once the first CCB deletion activity is done for a mini-
**  list of related cels in the larger list, the DeleteCelList() routine would be
**  walking NextPtr links through cels that have already been freed.  The memory
**  could already have been given to and modified by another task, and we could
**  end up in the middle of nowhere (or worse, end up crashing the machine).  To
**  allow DeleteCelList() to work correctly, a creator that returns a mini-list of
**  related cels can set the creatorData field to point to the last cel in the
**  mini-list.  The internal_delete_cel() routine uses this to advance to the end
**  of the mini-list, so that DeleteCelList() effectively jumps over the mini-list
**  after it is deleted, and continues processing with any other cels linked into
**  the larger list created by the application.  When CALLBACK style deletion is
**  used, the creatorData field is already used for callback data.  In this case,
**  the callback routine is responsible for returning a pointer to the next CCB
**  following the CCB(s) it deleted.  If the callback returns NULL, that indicates
**  that no CCBs were linked into the list beyond the ones the callback deleted.
**  NOTE that there is a very important subtle distinction here:  For non-callback
**  deletion, the creatorData points to the last CCB in the mini-list (or is NULL);
**  the internal_delete_cel() function calculates the next larger-list pointer by
**  following NextPtr from the last CCB pointed to by creatorData.  For callback
**  deletion, the following of NextPtr is done by the callback routine; the
**  callback's return value is not a pointer to the last CCB it deleted, it is a
**  pointer to the next CCB in the larger list, or NULL if there is no next CCB.
**
**  Helpful hint for callbacks:  While there is only one longword available
**  for creatorData ahead of the CCB in the magic data area, the CCB could
**  could have any number of extra longwords at the end of it, which might
**  mean something to the callback routine.  The creator of the cel can
**  simply allocate a bit more memory than is needed for the CCB, and hide
**  its extra data there, then the callback routine can find it there at
**  delete time and do something with it.  This is why the AllocMagicCel_()
**  routine takes an extraBytes parm that says how much extra memory to
**  allocate as part of the magic data/CCB allocation.

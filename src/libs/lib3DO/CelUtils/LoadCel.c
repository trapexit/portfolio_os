**
**  Lib3DO routine to allocate a buffer and load a cel
**  into it using fast block I/O, then parse the cel.
**
**  DeleteCel() compatible.
**
**  We have to meet a pair of goals here:  Load a cel file in such a way that
**  it can later be unloaded with a call to UnloadCel() (or DeleteCel()), and
**  do so without loading into one buffer then copying to another (which requires
**  twice as much memory, and is slower).  ParseCel() returns a pointer to
**  a CCB which it has located within the file buffer.      That pointer won't
**  be at a known offset from the start of the buffer however, so we need
**  a way for UnloadCel() to be able to find the start of the allocated
**  block containing the CCB we found when parsing the buffer.
**
**  One given that we do have to work with is that wherever we find the
**  CCB within the file buffer, we know there are 12 bytes of groodah in
**  front of it that can be safely trashed (the chunk ID, size, and version for
**  the CCC chunk).  So, after we've parsed out the CCB from the cel and
**  have its pointer all ready to return to the caller, we lay the DeleteCel
**  magic into the 12 bytes in front of the CCB.  We use the DATA_ONLY flavor
**  of DeleteCel magic, so that the DeleteCel() routine will free the file
**  buffer pointed to by the free.data word, but won't attempt to free the CCB
**  itself (since it's located within the file buffer).
**
**  This bit of sneakiness works because the DeleteCelMagic system was
**  designed with the LoadCel() function in mind - with LoadCel() we have 12
**  bytes of junk we can safely tweak right before the CCB, and DeleteCelMagic
**  requires exactly 12 bytes of magic appearing right before the CCB.
**
**  We use the ModifyMagicCel_() service routine to add the magic data to the
**  12-byte memory chunk right before the CCB.

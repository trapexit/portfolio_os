**
**  Lib3DO timer services and utilities.
**
**  The Get and Sleep functions are 'passive' timer utilities; they execute in
**  the context of the calling task and don't return until the requested action
**  is completed.  The TimerMsg and TimerSignal functions are 'active' timer
**  utilties which run in the context of a separate service thread and notify
**  the caller of completion via message or signal.
**
**  For all functions which take an ioreq parm, that parm is optional.  If
**  you pass a zero the functions will allocate an ioreq internally and delete
**  it before returning.  For repeated calls to these functions it is more
**  efficient to allocate an ioreq and pass it in on each call (like you have
**  to do with WaitVBL() and VRAM operations).
**
**  All functions which work with separate second and microsecond values have
**  internal logic to handle microsecond inputs greater than 1 million.  (For
**  example, you can express 2 seconds as 2,0 or 0,2000000).  Values returned
**  to you from Get functions always have the values normalized (usecs will be
**  less than 1 million.)
**
**  Functions with USec in the name deal with separate seconds and microseconds
**  values.  Functions with TSec in the name deal with a single value which
**  expresses time in 10ths of a second.  Functions with HSec deal with 100ths
**  of a second.  Functions with MSec deal will 1000ths (milliseconds).
**  Functions with no qualifier in the name deal with whole seconds.
**
**  Getting time in terms of 10ths, 100ths, or 1000ths of a second is a
**  convenience; you can get accurate intervals expressed as an easy-to-handle
**  single integer value, but the values will overflow an int32 representation
**  eventually.  For 10ths of a second, it takes about 7 years of continuous
**  running for the values to overflow.  For 100ths it takes roughly 250 days
**  of continuous running to overflow.  And for 1000ths it takes roughly 25
**  days (surprise surprise) to overflow.  Only the GetXXXXTime() functions
**  are sensitive to the overflow problem; the Sleep routines will always work
**  just fine regardless of how long the machine has been on.
**
**  All this overflows-in-some-number-of-days stuff assumes that the system
**  microsecond clock starts at zero seconds at power-on (which is true now,
**  and seems likely to continue to be the case).  It also means that the
**  functions start returning bogus values after the machine has been powered
**  on for that long, not just that you can't time intervals longer than that.
**
**  The overflow periods can be doubled if you choose to interpret the returned
**  values as a uint32, but this of course prevents you from detecting error
**  return values.  Of course, errors aren't very likely as long as you pass
**  a valid IOReq item.  That is, anything that's likely to go wrong in
**  obtaining the time or sleeping is also likely to bring the whole machine
**  down in various other ways.  The timer device is central to the OS's
**  proper functioning, and little can go wrong in working with it, other
**  than invalid IOReq items passed in by you, or failure to allocate an
**  IOReq (also indicative of an impending crash, I think) if you let these
**  routines do the allocation for you.

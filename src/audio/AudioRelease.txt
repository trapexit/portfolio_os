Release Notes for Audio Folio, Music Library, and related audio files

Phil Burk and Bill Barton

Version History

11/31/94

    audio folio ---------------------------

    Shared Templates - in an effort to save code memory, DSP instruments can
    now contain shared subroutines that are loaded automatically. The first
    instrument to support this is varmono8_s.dsp. If you require several
    varmono8 instruments, use this "varmono8_s.dsp" instead of "varmono8.dsp".
    Instruments loaded after the first instrument will use a subroutine
    contained in the first instrument. If you onlyneed one instrument, it is
    better to use the original version.

    Half Rate DSP Execution - in an effort to save execution cycles,
    DSP instruments can now be run at half the normal sample rate.
    If you are running out of ticks, then run some instruments at half rate.
    The output sample rate is half so fidelity is degraded.
    Fixed rate instruments will play an octave lower.
    Variable rate instruments played using AF_TAG_PITCH will
    adjust their pitch correctly although the maximum pitch will
    be 1/2 of the previous maximum.  Half rate instruments should
    be allocated in pairs to make most effective use of this feature.
    See documentation for CreateInstrument, AF_TAG_CALCRATE_DIVIDE
    for more information.

    A bug in SetAudioItemInfo() for samples has been corrected. If you
    accidentally pass illegal parameters to SetAudioItemInfo() it
    will no longer corrupt the sample values.  The sample will be left
    in the same state it was before calling SetAudioItemInfo().

    Some improvements to the handling of instrument state have been made.
    If you call StartInstrument() on an instrument that is running,
    it will do a complete stop before being restarted.

    Attachments with AF_ATTF_NOAUTOSTART set  will no longer
    accidentally start playing if you call:
          PauseInstrument()
          StopInstrument()
          StartInstrument()

    The audiofolio will now correctly load AIFF files that loop
    and have a MARK chunk after the INST chunk.  This bug prevented
    the audiofolio from loading samples compressed by SoundHack
    that had loops.

    The NumBits parameter for samples is now correctly recalculated
    if you change the width using AF_TAG_WIDTH.

    Fixed the DMA errors that could occur if AF_TAG_STARTAT was
    accidentally past the end of the sustain loop in a sample.
    Also corrected DMA errors for zero length loops.

    Prevented unnecessary interrupts from occuring for samples with release
    loops and MonitorAttachment() or the the FATLADYSINGS bit set. The
    interrupt was causing a 2% performance loss per looping sample. BTW, there
    is little point in using MonitorAttachment() or FLS bit for samples
    with release loop because they never finish.

    Fixed roundoff error that was causing load problems with odd length
    compressed samples.

    DisconnectInstruments() now restores the functionality of Knobs
    on the destination instrument. Knobs used to not work after
    one had used ConnectInstruments() to connect a signal to a Knob,
    then disconnected.

11/12/94

    audio folio ---------------------------

    Removed MakeSample() prototype from audio.h. This function is now obsolete,
    but is maintained in the audio folio for backwards compatibility. For new
    code, use CreateSample() instead.

10/13/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Original sound file player now asks the file system for block size
    rather than assuming it is always 2048 bytes.

10/11/94

    audio folio 23.10 10/11/94 16:33:47 ---

    Hid the prototypes for a few internal functions:

        ReservedAudioSWI1()
        TestHack()
        PrivateInternal()
        IncrementGlobalIndex()

    Removed the prototypes and glue for following unimplemented functions:

        FindAudioDevice()
        ControlAudioDevice()
        GetNumInstruments()
        GetMasterTuning()
        SetMasterTuning()
        DSPGetMaxTicks()

    The implementation, what there was of it at any rate, is still intact
    in the audio folio in case someone actually was calling these. Most of
    them just return AF_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED as they have always done.

10/10/94

    audio.lib (private) -------------------

    Added SuperSetAudioFolioInfo() and SuperSetAudioFolioInfoVA():
    supervisor entry point for SetAudioFolioInfo().

10/4/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Added ssplGetSpoolerStatus() to sound spooler. This subsumes the
    functionality of ssplIsSpolerActive() (which is preserved as a macro).

10/4/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Revised advanced sound player API after review:

    1. create/delete documentation clarified wrt precisely what is freed
       when a delete call is called (includes spDeletePlayer(),
       spRemoveSound(), spRemoveMarker()).

    2. create functions that return pointers now have the following form:

        Err spCreatePlayer (SPPlayer **resultPlayer, ...)

    3. spGetPlayerSignals() changed to spGetPlayerSignalMask()

    4. Added the following functions:

        SPPlayer *spGetPlayerFromSound (const SPSound *);
        SPSound *spGetSoundFromMarker (const SPMarker *);

    5. Added tsp_spoolsoundfile.c (version of spoolsoundfile.c that uses
       the advanced sound player).

    6. Reformatted examples to fit in 80 columns.

    7. Changed typedef names to use an upper-case prefix 'SP'.

    8. Replaced spGetPlayerState() w/ spGetPlayerStatus() which returns a
       more informative set of flags rather than a state enum value.

    9. Replaced SPAction system (the result of an SPDecisionFunction)
       with a less obtuse mechanism.

    10. Added spGetMarkerName() and spGetMarkerPosition().

9/21/94

    audio folio 23.10.268 -----------------

    Added GetAudioFolioInfo() to query system-wide audio settings.
    Will be available in audio folio V24.

9/8/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Added ssplUnrequestBuffer() to sound spooler to return an
    unused SoundBufferNode to the free queue.

    Added a resource tracking system in sound spooler to prevent
    loss of SoundBufferNodes in case client fails to use one
    returned by ssplRequestBuffer(). The sound spooler used to lose
    memory and track of a couple of items if this happened.

8/24/94

    dsp -----------------------------------

    Added several new DSP instruments:
    add.dsp
       code=6, ticks=6
       Output = InputA + InputB  (clipped)
    benchmark.dsp
       code=6, ticks=6
       Output is current Tick count.  Used by ta_faders.c for more
       accurate benchmarking of DSP.
    adpcmvarmono.dsp
       code=70, ticks=108
       Variable rate ADPCM decoding. Freq range is 0 -> 0x8000 only.
    dcsqxdvarmono.dsp
       code=56, ticks=59
       Variable rate SQXD decoding. Freq range is 0 -> 0x8000 only.
    subtract.dsp
       code=6, ticks=6
       Output = InputA - InputB  (clipped)
    maximum.dsp
       code=11, ticks=12
       Output = MAX(InputA,InputB)
       This can be used for clipping.
       By connecting Output to InputB, you can measure a historical maximum.
    minimum.dsp
       code=11, ticks=12
       Output = MIN(InputA,InputB)
       This can be used for clipping.
       By connecting Output to InputB, you can measure a historical minimum.

8/9/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Added Advanced Sound Player package to music.lib (see spCreatePlayer()
    and soundplayer.h). Will be available in music.lib V24.

8/8/94

    audio folio -----------------

    CompressionRatio < 1 for a sample now rejected as an error.

    dsp -----------------------------------

    The dsp instruments fixedstereosample.dsp and fixedstereo16swap.dsp
    had a bug fixed.  The bug could cause the stereo left/right to be reversed
    sometimes from their normal side whan StartAttachment() was called.
    fixedstereosample.dsp had a 0.7% probability of being switched.
    fixedstereo16swap.dsp had a 2% probability of being switched.

8/5/94

    audio folio 22.10.234 -----------------

    Made audio folio demand loadable. Among other things, this involved
    changing the file name from $folios/audiofolio to $folios/audio.

    Currently the operator automatically starts the audiofolio during boot
    since it's always been there up 'til now. There is no longer a command
    in startopera script to launch the audio folio.

7/14/94

    audio folio ---------------------------

    Added varargs versions of all audio folio functions that take TagArgs
    (e.g. StartInstrumentVA()).

7/7/94

    audiofolio ----------------------------

    AttachEnvelope() now uses the default name "Env" when passed a NULL
    name.

6/15/94

    examples ------------------------------

    Added ta_delay.c to examples.

6/8/94

    audiofolio ----------------------------

    Caller to SetAudioFolioInfo() must now be priveledged.
    SetAudioFolioInfo() now adjusts the ticks available
    based on the Samplerate.

    Optimised several DSP instruments. The following changes
    were then made to the DSP instrument statistics document.

Instrument            Cod Tks  => Cod Tks   Comment
-----------------------------------------------------------------
adpcmhalfmono.dsp     xx  xx   =>  71 103   new
directin.dsp          xx  xx   =>   6   6   new
fixedmonosample.dsp   10  15   =>   6   6   optimised
fixedstereo16swap.dsp 42  46   =>  38  46   optimised
fixedstereo8.dsp      19  39   =>  15  15   optimised
fixedstereosample.dsp 16  23   =>  10  10   optimised
halfmonosample.dsp    28  30   =>  23  21   optimised
halfstereosample.dsp  xx  xx   =>  44  36   new
pulse.dsp             xx  xx   =>  14  13   new
pulse_lfo.dsp         xx  xx   =>  23  24   new
randomhold.dsp        13  25   =>  13  15   recalibrated
square.dsp            xx  xx   =>  12  13   new
square_lfo.dsp        xx  xx   =>  16  17   new
svfilter.dsp          22  22   =>  19  19   optimised
triangle_lfo.dsp      xx  xx   =>  23  24   new
varmono8.dsp          67  37   =>  50  38   updated document


6/6/94

    audiofolio ----------------------------

    Added CompareAudioTimes(), AudioTimeLaterThan() and
    AudioTimeLaterThanOrEqual() macros to audio.h. These macros should be
    used for comparing AudioTime quantities because they deal with the
    wraparound condition. If you just compare times using (t1>t2) then
    your app could break when the clock wraps at 109 days after boot.

6/6/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Modified score player to permit assigning more than one voice
    to a single MIDI note number.

    audiofolio ----------------------------

    Added time stamp comparison to ScavengeInstrument().

    Fixed bug in conversion of NumBytes to Frames for samples.
    If you had a 2:1 compressed sample, and tried to set both
    AF_TAG_FRAMES and AF_TAG_NUMBYTES to an odd value in the
    same call to SetAudioItemInfo(), they would be reported
    as unequal and return an error. This may have also affected
    the setting of loop points at the end of 2:1 compressed samples.
    The problem was due to roundoff error in the conversion.

5/31/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Made ssplCreateSoundBufferNode() and ssplDeleteSoundBufferNode() functions
    internal only. This was done because these functions do not actually
    perform as advertised and could really only be used as low level functions
    by ssplCreateSoundSpooler() and ssplDeleteSoundSpooler() without a major
    overhaul. Anyone using them would have discovered this pretty quickly. If
    there is sufficient demand, ssplCreateSoundBufferNode() and
    ssplDeleteSoundBufferNode() could be reworked to behave as described, but
    until then, they no longer exist.

5/7/94 21.10.577

    audiofolio ----------------------------

    Fixed a bug in envelope creation and modification that failed to
    return an error code for bogus loop points. It now returns
    AF_ERR_BADTAGVAL when you try to set invalid loop points.

5/27/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Added new SoundBufferFunc callback system to sound spooler.

5/7/94 21.10.489

	audiofolio ----------------------------

	Added SetAudioFolioInfo() to allow cable apps to
	inform audiofolio of DAC sample rate changes.
	Also provides master gain control for muting.
	Uses new head.dsp.

5/5/94

	audiofolio ----------------------------

	Made envelopes wait at least 1 timer tick to allow very fast
	attacks to rise properly.  Was rounding to zero delay. "EA laser fix"


4/29/94

	audiofolio ----------------------------

	MakeSample() no longer returns an error code if you mistakenly
	pass NumBytes, and also pass an address via TagList.  This was
	to prevent some errant apps from crashing.

4/27/94 Anvil D1

	audiofolio ----------------------------

	Added Audio Input support for Anvil. Here's how:

	Enabled = EnableAudioInput( TRUE, NULL );
	ADCIns = LoadInstrument( "directin.dsp", 0, 100 );
	ConnectInstrument( ADCIns, "OutputLeft", SVFilter, "Input" );

	TuneInsTemplate() has been implemented since 4/6/94

	Fixed DSPReadEO taglist bug (internal bug, never actually in a release
    version of audiofolio)

4/22/94

    patchdemo -------------------

    Added delay line support.

4/19/94

    includes --------------------

    audio.h 1.61: Restored #include <> back to "" to keep examples
    building without massive changes to the build scripts.  The <>'s will
    reappear in the next release.

4/15/94

	music.lib -----------------------------

	Fixed a bug that was only present in the alpha version that
	caused the dsp instrument used by the soundfile player to not
	be deleted by UnloadSoundFile().

4/14/94

	audiofolio ----------------------------

	Fixed bug that caused instruments with more than one envelope
	to possibly hang if the FATLADYSINGS bit was set for an envelope.

	Fixed a time comparison that could cause a glitch in the timer
	after 109 days of continuous operation.

4/13/94

    music.lib -----------------------------

    Split score.o into 3 modules:
        . score_mfloader.o - score player's MIDI File loader
        . score_pimaploader.o - PIMap loader
        . score.o - lower level score player functions

    The main benefit from this comes from moving the MIDI file loading
    stuff into a separate module since it depends on midifile.o,
    flex_stream.o, and juggler.o.  A score player client that doesn't
    require the MIDI file loader will now be about 9K smaller.

4/12/94

    audiofolio ----------------------------

    Fixed low mem hit in GetAudioItemInfo() that occurred when it was fed
    a bad item number.

4/11/94

    examples ------------------------------

    Retired patchdemo.rtf in favor of the patchdemo docs prepared by the
    documentation folks.

4/7/94

	audiofolio ----------------------------

	Reduced size of dev version by 22K by removing TRACE messages,
	and some ERR messages.  Compile them with DEBUG_AUDIO flag.

4/5/94
    testprograms (examples) ---------------

    Changed list of files published in the testprograms (examples/audio)
    directory:
        . removed
            . cobj.h, handy_tools.h, iff_fs_tools.h, juggler.h,
              midifile.h, music.h, score.h, soundfile.h
                  - these are part of O/S and should never have been placed
                    in the testprograms directory.
            . joytools.c - not for release
            . leftright.arm - not for release
            . loopsoundfile.arm, loopsoundfile.c - not for release
            . ta_define.arm - not for release
            . ta_dualsaw.arm - not for release
            . ta_freqresp.arm - not for release
            . ta_polyphony.arm - not for release
            . ta_printins.arm - not for release
            . tg_lines.arm - not for release

        . added
            . patchdemo.*, pd_*.c, *.patch - PatchDemo set
            . ta_spool.arm, ta_spool.c

    dsp instruments ---------------

    Changed list of published dsp instruments:
        . removed
            . thru.dsp - test instrument that should not have been released

        . added
            . adpcmhalfmono.dsp
            . delay1tap.dsp
            . pulse.dsp
            . pulse_lfo.dsp
            . randomhold.dsp
            . square.dsp
            . square_lfo.dsp
            . triangle_lfo.dsp

4/4/94

	music.lib ---------------

	Fixed bug in PitchBend handling.  ConvertPitchBend wasn't
	centered at 0x2000.  New notes did not get current channel
	bend value.

4/3/94

	PatchDemo released by Bill Barton.  This 3DO based application will
	read a text file that describes a patch constructed out of dsp
	instruments, builds it, and lets you tweak its knobs.  See the examples
	folder for some sample patches.  Preliminary documentation is also available.
	The set consists of the following files:
	    . patchdemo.arm - program
	    . patchdemo.rtf - documentation (can be read w/ MS Word)
	    . *.patch - sample patches
	    . patchdemo.c, patchdemo.h, pd_faders.c, pd_patch.c - source code

3/21/94

	audiofolio ----------------

	Fixed pointer arithmetic bug in DMA control that was needed to counteract
	a very old compiler bug.  Now works with all the recent ARM compilers.

	music.lib -----------------

	New SoundSpooler available.  This tool allows an application to pass
	blocks of audio data to the audiofolio for playback.  It manages a queue
	of blocks and signals the application as they are played. This code
	is curently being used in the DatStreamer and in the music.lib sound
	file player.

3/9/94

	audiofolio 20.28.205 --------

	OpenAudioFolio() now waits until the folio is completely ready.
	This eliminates the possibility of race conditions on startup
	between the folio and the application.  A delay will no longer be needed
	in the StartOpera script for the audiofolio.  Other folios may still
	need the delay.  This was implemented by using semaphores in
	the folio open vector.

3/4/94

	includes --------------------

	audio.h no longer includes the following include files:
	    . device.h
	    . driver.h
	    . filesystem.h
	    . folio.h
	    . io.h
	    . stdio.h

	audio.h now uses <> instead of "" for refering to include files that
	it includes.  This requires using the following compiler options:
	    -wp - do not warn about non-ANSI files in #include <foofile.h>
	    -J  - instead of -I for include path to avoid getting ARMCC built-in
	          include files (e.g. uses 3DO stdio.h instead of ARMCC built-in
	          stdio.h).

2/27/94

	audiofolio 20.28.152 --------

	Share .dsp templates.  If a .dsp template is loaded more than once,
	the later ones will not go to disk but will simply share the dsp
	information.  This will reduce disk access and will speed up LoadPIMap().

	music.lib ---------

	Use SoundSpooler tool to improve ServiceSoundFile().  Use asynchronous
	file I/O so that ServiceSoundFile() will not block as long.

----------- New Version Numbering -------------------------

20.??.75 - 1/20/94 - JANUARY RELEASE

	audiofolio --------

	Use actual timer tick value generated by DSPP to advance audio timer.
	This will prevent timer drift if interrupts are lost due to
	overly long interrupt disables.

	music.lib ---------

	Remove "instrument used" message from LoadSoundFile() to avoid delay.

20.??.74 - 1/20/94

	audiofolio --------

	Remove BETA message.
	Remove "DMA not stopped" message that appeared because of compiler
	optimisation.  It is safe.

	music.lib ---------

	LoadPIMap() now handles TABs in PIMap text file correctly.

20.24.73 - 12/22/93

	Rewrote playmf.c as simpler pmf routines to improve clarity.

	music.lib ---------

	ServiceSoundFile() now uses Asynchronous file I/O to prevent blocking of
	spooling task.

	Fixed GetObjectInfo() for Collections with JGLR_TAG_MANY and for
	Sequences for superclasses tags.

	audiofolio --------

	Fixed range checking for AllocAmplitude() and FreeAmplitude().

	Added AF_TAG_CURRENT for GetAudioItemInfo for Knobs.
	Returns current value after any conversion has occured. Should match
	TweakRawKnob().  Optimised.

	Added AbortTimerCue() to cancel a SignalAtTime() request.  Tested
	using ta_timer.c

	Fixed bug in V72 DSPPNextAttachment - internal issue.

	Deallocate external entry point reference for shared DSP routines.
	Fixed minor memory leak in ADPCM usage.

20.24.72 - 12/20/93

	audiofolio --------

	Fixed problem with LinkAttachment() killing sustain loops.  Allow multiple
	ReleaseInstrument calls for linked attachments with sustain loops.

20.24.71 - 12/15/93

	audiofolio --------

	Added CreateSample(), CreateInsTemplate().

	Made name matching case insensitive for ConnectInstruments()
	and GrabKnob()

20.24.70 - 12/??/93

	audiofolio --------

	Implemented PauseInstrument() and ResumeInstrument()

	music.lib ----------

	Fixed new memory leak in MFLoadCollection introduced in V67.

	Fixed crash with invalid juggler objects if one played a new
	score after deleting an old score that was stopped before it ended.

20.24.69 - 12/01/93

	audiofolio --------

	Attachments are now tracked properly for templates as well as
	instruments.  Before this, if one attached a single sample to multiple
	templates, then one would get an "Unknown Slave" error when one deleted
	a template.

	Fixed bug with FATLADYSINGS and looping samples.  The release portion
	of a sample after a sustain loop was getting cut off by the FATLADYSINGS
	bit.  This was causing some pops and also causing instruments to cut
	out unexpectedly.  Also fixed bug where samples between sustain and
	release loop were not getting played.

	The detune value for samples is now taken into account when calculating
	the Base Frequency.  The value can range from +/1 100 Cents.  The value in
	an AIFF file can range from +/- 50 Cents.  A positive detune value raises
	the pitch when played.

	Convert12TET_F16( int32 Semitones, int32 Cents, frac16 *FractionPtr )
	added.  This converts an interval in Semitones and Cents to a fractional
	value that can be used with BendInstrumentPitch().  S=0,C=0 => Fr=1.0
	S=12,C=0 => Fr=2.0 ; S=-12,C=0 => Fr=0.5

	AF_TAG_PRIORITY <uint32>  can be used with GetAudioItemInfo() for
	Instruments to get the instrument priority.

	AF_TAG_START_TIME <uint32>  can be used with GetAudioItemInfo() for
	Instruments to get the time the instrument was started.

	AF_TAG_TIME_SCALE <frac16>  allows time scaling of envelopes.  This allows
	an app to scale envelopes based on PITCH or VELOCITY.  MICROSPERDELTA now
	supports envelope time units other than milliseconds.

	music.lib ---------

	LoadPIMap now support a -d option for detuning the sample. Value is in
	Cents.  A positive value raises the played pitch.

	Added PurgeScoreInstruments() and (*scon_PurgeHook)() to allow
	applications to share voice allocation with ScoreContext.

20.20.68 - 11/17/93

	audiofolio --------

	Clear head of DSPP FIFOs when sample started to reduce pops.

	MonitorAttachment() now works for envelopes. See ta_envelope.arm.

	WhereAttachment() now works for envelopes. See ta_envelope.arm.

	Fixed crash when RELEASEJUMP point set to last point in envelope. See ta_envelope.arm.

	CreateCue(Tags) and DeleteCue(Cue) macros added to audio.h

	music.lib ---------

	Moved SelectSamplePlayer() to own file to reduce size of applications
	that want to use soundfile spooler.

	LoadPIMap now recognises .aifc and .aif as samples, now case insensitive.

20.20.67 - 11/10/93

	audiofolio --------

	SetItemPriority now works for Audio Items.

	DSP Instruments added
		samplermod.dsp
		halfstereosample.dsp

	music.lib ----------

	Fixed hang in sound spoooler at end of file that was delayed.

	Reordered reads in RewindSoundFile() so that drive head is left on data.
	This should eliminate some problems with starting a soundfile cleanly.

	PitchBend support added.

	Reallocate MIDI File sequence data after load to save memory.

20.20.66 - 10/28/93

	GetAudioItemInfo() now supports AF_TAG_STATUS for instruments. Returns
	AF_ABANDONED, AF_STOPPED, AF_RELEASED, or AF_STARTED.

	CloseAudioFolio() no longer returns a -1 if called from multiple threads.

	music.lib ----------

	 Mute fixed in score player for MIDI scores with running status.

20.20.65 - 9/93

	Fixed: If one called CreateDelayLine() then tried to get rid of it with
		UnloadSample(), it would attempt to delete the delay line
		memory in user mode.  Since it was allocated in supervisor mode
		this would fail with a fence violation.

20.18.64 - 9/8/93 - released on Sampler CD

	Use FIFOINIT to clear FIFOs before starting samples, and to disable DMA
	on Initialization.

	Initialize allocated I memory to zero to reduce pops and DC offsets.

20.17.63 - 9/4/93 - OFFICIAL RELEASE 1.1

	Allow deletion of dependant items from parent item.  For example
		all attachments for a sample will be deleted when the sample
		is deleted.  This prevents the "wild write" that could occur
		when dependant items were later removed from a dead parent's list.

20.17.62 - 8/30/93

	Add more stringent error checks for:
		MonitorAttachment() - only accept CUE_AT_END
		Attachments - check for illegal flags
		LoadInsTemplate - AudioDevice must be zero
		Knob calls return proper error code for BadItems instead of 1.
		TuneInstrument checks tuning item properly.
		Check for negative counts for envelopes, tunings.
		Number of channels for samples must be from 1-255.

	Score.c - InitScoreMixer calls UpdateChannelVolume correctly.  This may
		have caused low volumes on higher MIDI channels.

	DisconnectInstrument now works if connected to Knob

	Disallow AudioDuration greater than 32767

20.14.61 - 8/24/93

	NAME chunks from Aria files no longer cause a memory leak.

	DHDR chunks placed in .dsp files to aid future compatibility.
	CRDC chunks allowed for Aria instruments future compatibility.
	Warning given for obsolete instruments that do not have the above chunks.

	Score player properly disconnects instruments when freed to avoid squeeks and
	squawks.

	IFF file parser properly seeks to end of chunk regardless of Custom
	Handler activity.

20.14.59 - 8/12/93

	Audio programs must be relinked with new audio.lib!!!!

	if (Kernel version > 19)  use SuperInternalFreeSignal()
	to avoid problem when task with Cues are killed.

	Moved GetAudioTime() to user level folio call.
	Applications will need to be relinked to take advantage of future
	folio stuff.

	ta_faders.c now takes a sample file name to play

	If SleepUntilTime() or SignalAtTime() are called from
	a task that does NOT own the Cue, an error is returned
	because they won't wake up.

int32 EZMemSetCustomVectors( void *(*AllocVector)(int32 Size, uint32 Type),
	 	void (*FreeVector)(void *p, int32 Size) )
	 added to allow the user of the music.lib to specify how
	 memory will be allocated.  Score and Juggler also use this.
	 Only set once before making any calls, or not at all.  Do not change
	 once set.

int32 MFDefineCollection ( MIDIFileParser *mfpptr, char *Image, int32 NumBytes, Collection *ColPtr)
	added to allow a MIDIFile to be loaded from memory instead of from disk.
	Added FlexStream tool to support this.

	Calling Audio routines from a thread that did not OpenAudioFolio()
	is now trapped as an error.

	Some other bugs related to Item deletion by the Shell were also
	fixed including the DSPPUnImportResource: Could not find external = %&$

20.11.58 - 8/9/93

	Added AF_TAG_RELEASEJUMP <index> which allows you to
	specify a point to jump to upon release.  This handy for piano like
	envelopes that have a long slow decay until you release when they drop
	to zero quickly.

	Added extra checks for illegal flags to allow future upgrades.

	PIMaps can now have blank lines.

	SoundFilePlayer now has a SFP_NO_DIRECTOUT flag that can
	be used to disable use of the directout instrument.  This
	allows you to connect the spooled sound to whatever you want.

	DSP files optimised, 2 NOPS removed from front make them incompatible
	with old folios.

8/3/93

	halfmonosample.dsp added for 22 Khz 16 bit mono samples.
	music.lib now supports halfmonosample.dsp

0.0.57 - 7/30/93 - DragonTail3

	Fixed possible overindexed string in AttachEnvelope().

	Fixed error checking for NumBytes and NumFrames for
	samples items.  Used to say they didn't match for MakeSample().

	Improved delay line internals.

0.0.56 - 7/30/93

	Fixed inconsistency with the way sample width is handled
	for compressed samples.  Now width is the uncompressed width
	in bytes.  Thus a 16 bit sample in 4:1 ADPCM format should have
	a width = 2 bytes.

	Fixed voice allocation problem in music.lib that caused
	failures if a template was used on more than one channel
	at a time.  Other voice allocation improvements.

0.0.55 - 7/28/93

	Fixed stuck note bug in music.lib.
	Fixed running status bug in MIDI file reader in music.lib.
	Fixed bug that caused notes that had no matching multi-sample
		range to still play.

0.x.54 - 7/23/92

	Fixed bug in DSPPGoToAttachment() that caused looping in
	streamer for non-zero FIFOs.

0.x.53 - 7/23/92

	Fixed range check of AF_TAG_START_AT to allow 0 when NumFrames == 0.
	This was affecting the AudioSpooler.

0.11.52 - 7/23/92
New routines added:

Item   CreateDelayLine ( int32 NumBytes , int32 NumChannels, int32 IfLoop);
	Can be attached to instrument that provide DMA OUT from DSP.  For echoes,
	reverb, and oscilloscope applications.

int32  DeleteDelayLine( Item DelayLIne );

Item  DefineInsTemplate( uint8 *Definition, int32 NumBytes, Item Device, char *Name );
	Used to load a template from a .dsp file image that is in RAM. Intended for
	use with streaming data applications.

Item   DefineSampleHere ( uint8 *AIFFImage, int32 NumBytes, void *(*CustomAllocMem)(), void (*CustomFreeMem)());
	Used to load a sample from an AIFF image that is in RAM. Intended for
	use with streaming data applications.

New features:
	AF_TAG_START_AT  <frame> now supported for sample attachments.
		This allows you to start a sample in the middle.  Call SetAudioItemInfo()
		for the attachment before starting the instrument.

	If you don't specify the directory with a -d option when starting the AudioFolio,
	it will default to "$audio".

Bugs fixed:
	Data offset in SSND chunks now read properly.  This will probably have
	no apparent affect.

New DSP instruments:
	delaymono.dsp
		Writes Input to an output FIFO.  See ta_customdelay.c for an example.

0.0.50
Warning: Version numbers out of sequence because we all went to one
system (not mine). Look at the date to see who is latest.

	General transparent cleanup.

0.0.45

	Release Loop in samples supported.

1.1.41
	Assumes DAC setup done by ROM.
	If you have an older green system, you must specify a DAC setup on the
	command line.  Try:    audiofolio -d/remote -c0xC0020F0F
	Item cleanup improved.

1.1.40
	Fixed DSPGetTotalRsrcUsed() for DRSC_TICKS
	Fixed DINI chunk in .dsp file to allow data initialization
	Fixed Item ownership for SuperDeleteItem for dependants

1.1.39
	Fixed Dead Attachment error when attachment deleted
	before Instrument.
	Fixed XREF of sample file from 3INS file.
	Audio Data structures are now private.  Use GetAudioItemInfo()
	to get information from an Item.  For example, to find out the
	address of a sample's data:
/*
** Get data from sample using by sending a Taglist that gets filled in with the
** current values.
*/
	Tags[0].ta_Tag = AF_TAG_ADDRESS;
	Tags[0].ta_Arg = NULL;
	Tags[1].ta_Tag = TAG_END;
	Result = GetAudioItemInfo(SampleItem, Tags);
	CHECKRESULT(Result,"GetAudioItemInfo");
	Data = Tags[0].ta_Arg;


1.1.38
	DSP Tick allocation added.
	DSP Instruments have ALLOC.TICKS specified.
	TAGS are now enumerated and compatible with the Tag Processor.
	Changing sample BaseNote updates BaseFrequency so tuning of scores
	now works properly.

1.1.36
	Added ARM access to I memory via SEMAPHORE.
	This will allow DSP variable initialization and table loading,
	and envelope presetting.

1.1.35
	Envelopes fixed.  Envelope can be loaded from 3INS file.
	Cleaned up dependant Item deletion, ie. Attachments.

1.1.34
	PARANOID memory check to verify proper allocation and free.

1.1.32
	Added WhereAttachment.
	int32 WhereAttachment( Item Attachment )
	This will give you the byte index of where the current sample
	attachment is. Starts at zero.  Negative is an error.
	Does not yet work with Envelopes.

1.1.31
	Envelopes temporarily broken.

	Supports run-time stack checking in dragon.
	Stack must be set to at least 3000 before running AudioFolio
	or audio applications.  Enter  "stack 5000" into shell.

1.1.29
	Synthetic waveforms now support proper tuning.
	See ta_tuning.c example.
	Item  CreateTuning( ufrac16 *Frequencies, int32 NumNotes, int32 NotesPerOctave, int32 BaseNote );
	int32 DeleteTuning( Item Tuning );
	int32 TuneInsTemplate( Item InsTemplate, Item Tuning );
	int32 TuneInstrument( Item Instrument, Item Tuning );

1.1.28
	Added Envelope support.
	Item  AttachEnvelope( Item Instrument, Item Envelope, char *EnvName );
	int32 DetachEnvelope( Item Attachment );
	Item  CreateEnvelope( DataTimePair *Points, int32 Numpoints,
			int32 SustainBegin, int32 SustainEnd );

	spoolsoundfile.c modified to loop sound files
	5/28/93
	Dynamic voice allocation and multisampling for scores added.
	ScavengeInstrument() added.
	SetAudioItemInfo() for Samples now returns 0 if OK.

1.1.26
	Force Silence after attachment if none linked.
	LinkAttachment can now be called while a sample is playing.
		If the first Attachment is playing, it will set the link
		properly to the second attachment.

1.1.25
	Removed check for NumBytes==0 in Sample Tags because we
	need this if memory deallocated.
1.1.24
	Removed Clicks from Linked Attachments
1.1.23
	LoadSampleHere( Name, AllocFUnction, FreeFunction) added.
1.1.22
	AdoptInstrument and AbandonInstrument added.

1.1.16   5/6/93  Cardinal 2b
	Proper reporting of DSP resource allocation failure.
	Look on 3DO InfoServer for late breaking Audio news and score player docs.

1.1.15   5/4/93  Cardinal Plus
	Improved handling of DMA to prevent rare collisions. (SBounce fix)
	Improved tracking of Items so that Attachments and other dependant
		items are automatically deleted.
	SampleRate now read for AIFF files.

	playsoundfile.c now uses the signals from linked attachments.
		This is an improvement over the original design which polled
		the DMA.

	New example: ta_faders.arm for tweaking an instrument. Try:
		ta_faders.arm sawfilteredsaw.dsp
	Use joypad to change fader levels.

	New DSP instruments:
		fixedmono8.dsp
		halfmono8.dsp
		submixer4x2.dsp
		submixer8x2.dsp

	New MIDI File score playing support in Music Library.
		Supports 8 bit (44100), 8 bit (22050), compressed (44100), variable 16
		bit.
		PIMap supports -f option for fixed sample rate playback for percussion.
			4 /remote/aiff/tomtom.aiff -f

	New audiodemo.lib with miscellaneous stuff to support demo programs. Includes:
		easy joypad reading using eventbroker
		simple graphics tools

1.1.12		3/26/93  Final Cardinal
	Implemented support for streaming audio. One can now link
		sample buffers using LinkAttachment.  The following
		routines now work:
			LinkAttachment()
			MonitorAttachment()
			StartAttachment()
			ReleaseAttachment()
			StopAttachment()
		See ta_attach.arm for an example.
		This also fixes the click when sampler instruments are released.

1.1.09		3/19/93
	Changed Loudness to Amplitude

1.1.07		3/12/93  Early Cardinal
	Many changes to the API and many new routines added.
	The major areas affected are voice stealing, tuning, sample
	and envelope control, and instrument control.  Many of these
	routines are not fully functional but are included to make the
	intended API explicit.  Please see the Microsoft Word
	document for details of the API changes.
	Added Juggler, a hierarchical event playing system
	that can be used to play MIDI files.
	See tj_simple.c and tj_multi.j.  This is brand new and
	is subject to change.

1.1.04		3/11/93
	UnloadInstrument now unloads the associated template.
	UnloadInsTemplate now unloads any attached samples.

1.1.03		3/09/93
	Load compound 3INS instruments with embedded samples.

1.1.02		3/02/93
	StopInstrument does not set Loudness=0 anymore.  This would cause
	instruments to go silent if started twice with no tags.

1.1.00		2/11/93
	Official Magneto6 release.
	Added error text for SysErr().
	Updated to be compatible with Magneto6 system.
	Support for AIFC compressed file formats.
		SDX2 compressed files can be created using a tool
		written by Darren Gibbs at 3DO.  These can be played
		using the dcsqxdmono.dsp instrument.

1.0.23		2/10/93
	Added Resource Query routines for Aria.
		int32 DSPGetInsRsrcUsed( Item InstrumentItem, int32 RsrcType );
		int32 DSPGetTotalRsrcUsed( int32 RsrcType );
		See ta_printins.c for an example of their use.

1.0.22		2/9/93
	New Audio Timer based on DSP interrupt runs at 240 Hertz.
		Rate can be changed.  See audio.h for API.
		Requires new head.dsp file!
	Support for AIFC (AIFF-Compressed) files.
		Recognizes SDX2 compression type.
	Added ALL_VOICES to audio.h.  Use with ReleaseInstrument()
		as a VoiceID to release all voices.
1.0.21
	LoadSample and LoadInstrument return proper error code.


1.0.20
	Name change:  ofx/*.ofx changed to dsp/*.dsp
		Please use new names.
	AudioFolio now uses relative pathnames to find ofx files
		on startup.  It no longer uses the cdrom.image "/ad".

1.0.19
	Recompiled with new ARM Compiler because of compiler bug when
		handling (uint16 *).

1.0.18
	Add validation to Sample Data addresses.
	Folio only frees sample data memory when allocated by Folio.
		Uses asmp_FolioOwns field.
	AudioSample structure changed. Use char instead of int32
		for several small fields.

1.0.17
	AttachSample and DetachSample now take a FIFOName or NULL
	instead of a SampleIndex.  Previously 0 was passed as an index.
	If NULL is passed, the sample will be connected to all FIFOs
	for compatibility with previous versions.  When Detached, NULL
	causes all attachments for that sample to be detached.
	This allows us to use multiple samples in an instrument for
	different purposes, eg. cross modulation.  This change was required
	to support 3D Sound.

1.0.16
	Added check for bad relocations in ofx file.  These were caused
	by the Macintosh converting 0x0A to 0x0D when the file was transferred
	from the Sun.
	Added checks for bad FORM size.  This would cause some bad files
	built on the Iris to be rejected because they were built incorrectly.

1.0.15
	Removed SoundFile support from folio, moved to music.lib
	Added ScanSample to Audio Folio and playsoundfile.c example.
	Fixed DSPP code list manager,
	Added MakeSample - see ta_makesample.c
	Makefile use .arm suffix for executables
	Fixed RBASE allocation to allow more voices.
	Added playsoundfile.c
	Added AllocLoudness, FreeLoudness, MakeSample
	Added GetAudioTime, SleepUntilAudioTime
	Added mixer8x2.ofx
	Fixed last channel in mixer4x2.ofx - pipeline error
	Added fixedmonosample.ofx, fixedstereosample.ofx
	Added DisconnectInstruments() - see testaudio.c
	Added GetAudioRate() - see ta_timer.c

	Added experimental score playing ability.  This is
	a first pass and will certainly change.  Let us know what
	you want.  To use it, call:
		stack 20000
		playmf.arm {midifilename} {psmapfilename}
	You must increase stack size to 20000 or so to avoid an
		ugly crash.
	The midifile must be format0 and is restricted to the
	first 8 channels.  The psmapfile should contain lines
	with a program number followed by a sample name. For
	an example, see: /remote/aiff/default.psmap.  To test
	this tool, enter:
		playmf.arm
	It will default to a simple melody and sample map.
	See score.h and playmf.c for info.  Very rough at this stage.

1.0.14
	Runs on Magenta system

1.0.13
	Tested decompression tool dcsqxdmono.ofx - it works.
	Added svfilter.ofx, noise.ofx, timesplus.ofx, multiply.ofx.
	Added support for Playing Sound Files, see new calls below.
	Renamed SetTrace to TraceAudio.
		Example:   OldTraceMask = TraceAudio(TRACE_TOP|TRACE_SAMPLE);
	Sound from multiple tasks' mixers should now mix properly.

uint32 __swi(AUDIOSWI+9) TraceAudio ( int32 Mask );
	Sets bits to enable/disable diagnostics, see audio.h.
	TRACE_TOP TRACE_INT TRACE_ITEM TRACE_SAMPLE can be ORed.
	Use Mask = -1 to get all diagnostics.
int32 DSPGetRsrcAlloc ( Item InstrumentItem, int32 RsrcType, char *Name, int32 *Alloc);
	Returns allocated value for resource, eg. DRSC_INFIFO "InFIFO" sets
	Alloc to allocated DMAChannel
void *DSPWhereDMA ( uint32 DMAChannel );
	Returns current DMA pointer for channel.
Item OpenSoundFile ( char *Name, int32 BufferSize );
	Reads sound file, sets up for I/O, sets asmp_DataOffset, preloads two buffers.
int32 ReadSoundFile( Item SampleItem, int32 Cursor, int32 BufIndex);
	Reads sound into next buffer from byte=Cursor.  Currently too slow.
int32 CloseSoundFile ( Item SampleItem );

1.0.12
	Fixed bug in DetachSample that caused crash second time.
	Use cdrom.image for ofx files. Now have directories:
	cdrom.image - "/ad/ofx" "/ad/aiff" "/ad/mf"
	remote - "/remote/ofx" "/remote/aiff" "/remote/mf"
	/remote is slower but lets you drop files in from Mac side.
	Better handling of errors in AIFF files.
	Added decompression instrument dcsqxdmono.ofx - unheard.
	First release of audiomon.
	Added ta_longsamp to play forever.

1.0.11
	Allow multiple DSPP external routines with multiple entry points.
	Add SetTrace(Level) for debugging. Add LoadInstrument call to
		replace LoadInsTemplate and AllocInstrument.
	Changed AttachKnob to GrabKnob, DetachKnob to ReleaseKnob,
		and PutKnob to TweakKnob.  Add head.ofx and tail.ofx to
		allow DSP benchmarking.

1.0.10
	DSPP Resource Allocation and Free implemented.  Eliminates
	need to restart after every use.  Added ta_randknobs

1.0.6
	First Release to developers
	Added ConnectInstruments. Mixers must now be connected explicitly.

1.0.8
	Use official FileSystem.  Must now ChangeDirectory("/remote")
	All file I/O moved above fence.

1.0.1
	Don's and Stan's fixes to match BlueShift, set DAC for Bluto

1.0.0
	First internal release

--------------------------------------------------------------
CodeBreakers - these changes will break your code!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


20.14.59
	Audio programs must be relinked with new audio.lib!!!!

20.11.58
	New optimised DSP instruments will not work with OLD
	folios.  You do not need to change your code.  Just
	use NEW DSP files only with new folios.

1.1.29
	TweakKnob() now converts 16.16 Frequency in Hertz to device rate
	for synthetic waves such as sawtooth.  Thus the frequency you hear
	has changed. Use TweakRawKnob() to bypass this conversion process.

1.1.16
	DSP instruments are designed for Red.  If using Blue hardware, use old
	dsp folder.

1.1.15
	MIDI File score player PIMaps now use CarriageReturn instead
		of LineFeed as a line terminator.

1.1.09
	Changed all references to Loudness to Amplitude.
	Loudness refers to a perceptual metric that is logarithmic.
	Amplitude refers a direct linear metric that is what we
	actually do.  This was causing much confusion. Thus:
		GrabKnob(MyIns, "Loudness");   becomes
		GrabKnob(MyIns, "Amplitude");

		AF_TAG_LOUDNESS becomes AF_TAG_AMPLITUDE
		MAXDSPLOUDNESS becomes MAXDSPAMPLITUDE
		AllocLoudness() becomes AllocAmplitude()

1.1.07
	To better support future hardware devices, and voice allocation,
	we changed the following:
		Item  LoadInsTemplate( char *Name, Item AudioDevice);
	The AudioDevice was changed to an Item, was a string.
		Item  LoadInstrument( char *Name, Item AudioDevice, uint8 Priority);
		Item  AllocInstrument( Item InsTemplate, uint8 Priority);
	The Priority was changed to uint8, was a uint32.
	The NumVoices parameter was droppped.

	To support the Attachment Item which is used for synchronizing with
	samples and envelopes, we changed these:
		Item AttachSample( Item Instrument, Item Sample, char *FIFOName );
	Now returns an Attachment Item.
		int32 DetachSample( Item Attachment );
	Now deletes Attachment Item, different parameters.

	AF_TAG_FREQ replaced by AF_TAG_RATE, new tag AF_TAG_FREQUENCY added.

	In order to provide a more generic, safe and sane, access to
	Audio Item internal data, we eliminated these routines:
		GetKnobInfo() and PutSampleInfo()
	and replaced them with:
		int32 SetAudioItemInfo( Item AnyItem, TagArg *tp );
	which sets Item data based on Tags, and
		int32 GetAudioItemInfo( Item AnyItem, TagArg *tp );
	which fills in the TagList based on contents of Item.

	Since the Voice allocation is now provided by a set of low level calls,
	we no longer use the VoiceID parameter.  This parameter was always
	ignored so we are not losing functionality by taking it away.
	The following calls are affected.
		int32 StartInstrument( Item Instrument, TagArg *TagList);
	Now returns int32, not a VoiceID,
		int32 ReleaseInstrument( Item Instrument, TagArg *TagList);
		int32 StopInstrument( Item Instrument, TagArg *TagList);
	no longer take a VoiceID.

	It is now necessary to run both the file system and the math folio
	before running the audiofolio.  Enter:
		fs
		operamath

1.0.22
	Old Knob function names now gone. Use GrabKnob(), TweakKnob(),
		ReleaseKnob().
	Audio Rate now defaults to 240 ticks/second but you can change it.

1.0.20
	Instrument templates now called dsp/*.dsp, not ofx/*.ofx.

1.0.17
	AttachSample and DetachSample now take a FIFOName or NULL.
	DetachSample must now be called when changing samples.

1.0.15
	test programs now have ".arm" appended
	Audio Folio now called audiofolio

1.0.8
	uses 3DO filesystem, files must be in /remote or a cdrom.image

1.0.6
	Must connect to mixer or directout to get sound.
